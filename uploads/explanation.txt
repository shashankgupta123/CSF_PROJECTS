1. Movie Genre Recommendation System (Multiple Regression & KNN)
Approach:
Data Collection: Gather user watch history, ratings, demographics, and genre preferences.
Feature Engineering: Convert categorical data (e.g., favorite genres) into numerical format.
Multiple Regression: Predict a user's preference score for different movie genres.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Find users with similar interests and recommend genres based on their watch history.
2. Identifying Users Likely to Rewatch Movies (Logistic Regression)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect data on rewatch frequency, genre preferences, and user demographics.
Feature Selection: Consider factors like past rewatch behavior, watch frequency, and movie genre preference.
Logistic Regression: Train a model where the target variable is Yes (Rewatches) / No (Doesn't Rewatch).
Evaluation: Use confusion matrix, precision-recall, and F1-score for performance measurement.
3. Clustering Users Based on Movie Watching Habits (K-Means)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect data on users' watch time, frequency, favorite genres, and interaction with content.
Feature Engineering: Normalize features for better clustering.
K-Means Clustering: Group users into categories such as "Casual Watcher," "Movie Enthusiast," "Weekend Binger," etc.
Evaluation: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Clustering Users Based on Engagement Levels (K-Means / DBSCAN)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect engagement metrics like likes, shares, comments, and reviews.
Preprocessing: Normalize and remove outliers.
Clustering Algorithm: Apply K-Means or DBSCAN to identify "Highly Interactive Users," "Passive Viewers," and "Silent Fans."
Visualization: Use TSNE or PCA to plot clusters for better understanding.
6. Predicting Users’ Preference for Movies Based on Books (Naïve Bayes)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect user preferences for book-based movies.
Feature Engineering: Convert categorical preferences (Yes/No) into numerical values.
Model Training: Use Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify whether a user likes movies based on books.
Evaluation: Use accuracy, recall, precision, and confusion matrix.
7. Detecting Happy Ending Preference (Naïve Bayes)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect user data on genre preferences and past movie choices.
Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables and remove missing data.
Model Selection: Train a Naïve Bayes Classifier to predict whether a user prefers happy endings.
Evaluation: Use confusion matrix and classification report to analyze accuracy.
8. Predicting Suspense/Ending Preferences (Logistic Regression)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect user history of watching thriller/suspense movies.
Feature Selection: Consider suspense movie interest, past suspense movie ratings, and engagement.
Logistic Regression: Train a binary classification model to predict preference.
Evaluation: Use ROC curve, AUC score, and precision-recall curve.
9. Predicting User’s Movie Viewing Frequency (Random Forest)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect user demographics, genre preferences, and historical watch frequency.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant numerical features.
Random Forest Classifier: Predict user watch frequency category (Low/Medium/High).
Feature Importance: Use feature importance rankings to understand key predictors.
11. Detecting Movie’s Popularity Based on View Count (Regression)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect movie data including view count, ratings, genre, director, actors.
Feature Engineering: One-hot encode categorical variables like genres.
Regression Model: Use Random Forest Regressor or Linear Regression to predict view count.
Evaluation: Use RMSE, R-squared for accuracy measurement.
12. Predicting Daily Movie Watching Time (Random Forest)
Approach:
Dataset: Collect user past movie-watching duration data.
Feature Engineering: Extract features like total time spent, movie genre preference, time of the day watched.
Random Forest Regression: Predict the number of hours a user is likely to watch daily.
Evaluation: Use MSE (Mean Squared Error) and feature importance ranking.
